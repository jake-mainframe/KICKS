<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><i><font size="5">KICKS</font></i><font size="4"> is an enhancement
for CMS &amp; TSO that lets you run your CICS applications directly instead of having to
'install' those apps in CICS. You don't even need CICS itself installed
on your machine.</font></p>
<p><i><b>KICKS</b></i> provides a high level of source code compatibility with CICS
so you can move an application either way between CICS and <i><b>KICKS</b></i>
simply by recompiling. Whether for ease of testing, fast deployment to small
groups of your users, or simple &quot;guerrilla marketing&quot;, join your colleagues
using <b><i>KICKS</i></b> to speed up their development.</p>
<p>Being TSO/CMS based, <i><b>KICKS</b></i> can't support the many thousands of
users a multi-user system like CICS can. But if <i>
<b>KICKS</b></i> can't support thousands of users, it can certainly support a
few hundred of your users, and if having separate address spaces means it can't run as many users it also means
your users aren't so tied to each other's fates - one crash
does not kill all. This reduced consequence of failure often means your new
application's &quot;Time to Market&quot; can be dramatically shortened.</p>
<p>Like CICS, <i><b>KICKS</b></i> supports file sharing among its users. Hundreds of TSO
or CMS users share
db2 tables or VSAM files
with no more concern about doing so than CICS users - and since <i><b>KICKS</b></i>
VSAM support is also available in batch there's usually no need to &quot;close&quot; <i>
<b>KICKS</b></i> VSAM files just so such batch jobs can access them.</p>
<p>Unlike CICS, <i><b>KICKS</b></i> requires no special systems or security
services and can be
easily installed and used by a single applications programmer with a TSO or CMS account.
</p>
<h2><a name="VRM"></a>Version/Release encoding (VRM) </h2>
<p><i><b>KICKS</b></i> modification levels are encoded in a
Version/Release/Modification format. So for example its TSO distribution datasets
for this release are named as USERID.KICKS.V1R5M0.XXX, signifying version 1, release
5,
modification 0 (aka 1.5.0).</p>
<p>Since <i><b>KICKS</b></i> is highly modular, with separate nucleus management modules and
tables as well as components compiled and linked with user applications, <i><b>KICKS</b></i>
performs extensive version checking to ensure all components are compatible.
Eventually that will allow a newer release of <i><b>KICKS</b></i> to tolerate older
applications and maps, perhaps even older tables or even older
management modules in some cases. But for now the version checking is very
rigid: All components, including user applications and maps, must be at exactly
the same level. This means <u>you will have to recompile all your applications with
each new <i><b>KICKS</b></i> distribution</u>. The symptom of a version mismatch in your
application is a <b>VERS</b> abend (or similar, such as VER1, VER2, etc). </p>
<h2><a name="ReleaseHistory"></a>Highlights of release history </h2>
<p>1.5.0</p>
<ul>
	<li>Retired commercial <b><i>KICKS</i></b> and integrated its features into 
	the free version,
	including<ul>
	<li>Support for large screens (up to 62x160) via 14 bit sba's.</li>
	<li>Support for OCCURS in BMS maps.</li>
	<li>Shared intrapartition transient data queues.</li>
	<li>Shared temporary storage queues.</li>
	<li>Improved DB2 compatibility using SYNCPOINT exit to automatically drive
	database COMMIT/ROLLBACK.</li>
	<li>Enhanced application error recovery with HANDLE ABEND.</li>
</ul></li>
	<li>Enhanced application debugging with COBOL and GCC source code trace /
	breakpoint in KEDF.</li>
	<li>Release of full source code.</li>
</ul>
<p>1.4.1 (aka 'Golden' version)</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Added keyboard locking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1.4.0</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Ported <i><b>KICKS</b></i> to VM/CMS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What happened to the releases between 1.1.3 and 1.4.0 ?&nbsp; They never
existed. While in development of 1.1.4 we decided VRM was off track. 1.1.2 and 1.1.3 really should have been
1.2.0 and 1.3.0. We fixed it by changing VRM for the new release from 1.1.4 to
1.4.0.</p>
<p>1.1.3</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Added fielded input for sequential terminal (aka CRLP). Added support for 
	localization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1.1.2</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Added ENQ, DEQ, GETMAIN, and FREEMAIN api's and added NOHANDLE 
	support for all api's.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1.1.1</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Added support for coding <i><b>KICKS</b></i> COBOL applications using LE COBOL 
	on z/OS, and C applications using GCCMVS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1.1.0</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Added KEDF debugger, extrapartition transient data &amp; printing. Improved screen compatibility with CICS. 
	Added preprocessor support for modern 
	COPY syntax in the legacy COBOL compiler.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1.0.0 </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>The first real release of <i><b>KICKS</b></i>, implementing enough of the full CICS api that useful applications could be developed and run, and many existing
CICS applications could be ported to <i><b>KICKS</b></i>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>0.9.0 </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>An alpha distribution of <i><b>KICKS</b></i>. It initially lacked an MVS based
BMS map generator; a PC based Perl script had to be used to generate maps and
the resulting output upload to MVS for final processing. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="Goals"></a>Goals for the next release / level-set.</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The 1.5.1 release (mid 2015?) is primarily for 'z' users and will provide support for 31 
	bit applications and feature a preprocessor for IBM C and <b><i>KICKS</i></b> 
	build using that compiler.</li>
	<li>Some features of future releases may include 'trigger' queue processing, 
	IC (interval control), Journaling &amp; DTB (dynamic transaction backout), 
	dynamic table update (like CEDA), and a command
	level interpreter (like CECI).</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="MaintenanceSupport"></a>Maintenance/support plan for this release
</h2>
<p>1.5.0 requires that all user programs and maps be recompiled. </p>
<p><i><b>KICKS</b></i> has been tested been tested with z/OS thru 1.12 and with
the MVS38J&nbsp; &quot;Tur(n)key&quot; system including the base TK3 (the one on the CD) as
well as with TK3UPT, MVS380 and TK4-. It greatly benefits from the VTAM fixes and dynamic proclib support in
the newer TK3 versions, but does not require them. </p>
<p><i><b>KICKS</b></i> has been tested with z/VM thru 6.x and with
the VM/370 &quot;Six Pack&quot; system. Its usability with z/VM is limited by lack of
VSAM support on most z/VM systems.</p>
