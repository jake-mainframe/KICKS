Issues List</h2>
<p><b>TSO rawhide published 9/3/2014<br>
</b><br>
generated 9/3/14, <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">open</span><br>
<span style="background-color: #00FFFF">1</span>. noticed the READY READY issue
in z/OS. This is a long standing issue but not one I have seen previously except
in legacy MVS with the tcp=1$ driver. What happens is that, now and then, after the
colored 'KICKS is shutting down' message is shown you don't get the TSO ready
prompt. When you press enter again you get two READY prompts (usually white, not
red in legacy MVS). This does not happen with tcp=2$ or with any CMS tcp...<br>
- can't reliably make the problem appear, so difficult to tell if attempted
fixes work...<br>
- maybe due to leaving 'strange' stuff on the screen (such as the SA orders
associated with the shutting down message when <i><b>KICKS</b></i> ends.<br>
- fix? -9/3/2014 - changed KSSFPGM to do a clear screen after 2 second delay after
sending the colored shutdown mesage - so that the screen TSO sees will be
totally blank.<br>
** not the problem, 'fix' had no effect, issue remains<br>
- maybe due to not doing a read after colored letter write? Noted on z/OS that
the colored letters where not showing up!<br>
- fix? -9/25/14 - changed KSSFPGM to do a 'check' after colored letters write.<br>
** 10/4/2014&nbsp; <u>nope, not fixed</u> - READY READY appeared again (in
legacy MVS).<br>
- more info --&nbsp; 2/16/2015 can now reliably generate issue (on legacy MVS).
Generating procedure does not
generate ready-ready on z/OS, but does display possibly related issue in that
the KB is not locked after clear. Also noticed that I need to use QWS to test
this, as vista tn3270 seems to have a bug this procedure exposes ('short read'
for enter aid following clear aid). Also confirmed my &quot;expected&quot; result is
correct by trying in real CICS, and confirmed that it works properly in all CMS
versions of <i><b>KICKS</b></i> (and, within driver limitations, with tcp=2$ in
legacy MVS). At this point I'm testing to see if ready-ready may
be related to <i><b>KICKS</b></i> being called, not a command processor. <br>
<br>
reported 9/3/14, fixed 9/4/14<br>
<span style="background-color: #00FFFF">2</span>. KEBRPGM does not compile in
z/OS
due to compile diagnostic complaining about kik-aids1 being moved to a pointer
type.<br>
- this due to LOAD api (for KEBRHELP) generating code for 'move after' from
kik-aids1 used (off label) for entry/set to a pointer.<br>
- fix: updated KIKPPCOB (and PPGCC) to use given arg directly.<br>
- also, while I was at it, updated PPCOB, PPGCC, KIKPCP1$, and KEDF to separate
SET/ENTRY (now reporting both) and to make all LOAD args optional.<br>
<br>
reported 9/3/14 - resolved 9/5/14 - not a problem<br>
<span style="background-color: #00FFFF">3</span>. IEC161I 020-054 abend (re
SDBDATA) in TSO when trying to use source trace. (this is z/OS system) also &quot;1st startbr failed, resp=84, resp2=50&quot; message in kedf<br>
- this is an 'out of memory' situation. What's the region (below the line) for
the TSO session?<br>
- resolved - 2m region, <i><b>KICKS</b></i> doc says min 4m<br>
<br>
reported 9/4/14, fixed 9/4/14<br>
<span style="background-color: #00FFFF">4</span>. GCC test program LINKTST fails
due to 'testcob3' not abending!<br>
- this due to testcob3 not detecting condition to do FCP access to file NOFILE,
thus not abending. This due to PPGCC generating bad code in the case of an api
call directly following an if (ie, no preceding '{'), When that occurred PPGCC
gened a {linenum} {api expansion}, meaning the api expansion would not be within
the if as intended.<br>
- fix: updated PPGCC to add another set of brackets so it looks like {{linenum}
{api expansion}}<br>
- also, while I was at it, updated PPGCC to turn (8) error for missing KIKEIB in
main routine def into warning (4).<br>
<br>
reported 9/6/14 <span style="background-color: #FFFF99">queued to 1.5.1 release</span><br>
<span style="background-color: #00FFFF">5</span> Some GOLD and PRO markup still
exists.<br>
- 1.5.0 is a 'PRO' version, but since that's the only kind there is now the GOLD
&amp; PRO markup, thou still recognized, should be removed and when finally gone
PPCOB and PPGCC should have their recognition of it removed as well.<br>
<br>
<b>CMS rawhide published 9/7/2014<br>
</b><br>
generated 9/9/14, fixed 9/9/14<br>
<span style="background-color: #00FFFF">6</span> KUNLKED vrm wrong, so stamped
in vrm in KIKENTRY is wrong for anything using it Most everything really...<br>
- this is not vrm that is checked, except by eyeball, so it's ok in the rawhide,
but needs fixing before another publish<br>
- KUNLKED updated, fix will propagate next ADOALL...<br>
<br>
<b>TSO, source, and CMS rawhides published 9/22/2014<br>
</b><br>
generated 9/23/14, closed 9/28/14, all items addressed<br>
<span style="background-color: #00FFFF">7</span> z/OS source install issues<br>
NOTE - z/OS is not a &quot;supported&quot; build platform for <i><b>KICKS</b></i>,
but since some may want to casually play with the source on z/OS it seemed best to address
these issues by fixing them when easy, and by otherwise documenting them...<br>
- source install does not support update to JCLLIB for z/OS fixed 9/25/14<br>
- ADOALL jobs run out of order due to multiple initiators serving class A jobs.
Need to fix to run right, or run one at a time instead of using ADOALL.<br>
- added notes to ADOALL fixed 9/25/14 <br>
- FB2VB, PARMINFO, PDSUPDTE &amp; KIKALI do not compile various JCL issues<br>
- parminfo - not using proc, using mvt COBOL compiler<br>
not gonna fix, not used in z/OS closed 9/25/14<br>
- pdsupdt$ - using ASMFCL proc, doesn't work in z/OS<br>
not gonna fix, used only in install, closed 9/25/14<br>
- fb2vb - fixed 9/24/14<br>
- kikali<br>
not really a 'source' issue, but exposed in source testing...<br>
fixed 9/25/14<br>
- MUR &amp; TAC examples do not compile<br>
- these should compile from .CB2 lib, not from .COB lib<br>
added notes to ADOALL &amp; KIKSAMP fixed 9/25/14<br>
- ASRB (ASRA, AICA) routine does not compile. also SIP won't<br>
link due to missing ASRB routine<br>
- jcl issue<br>
fixed 9/25/14<br>
- COB glue routine does not compile.<br>
- jcl issue<br>
fixed 9/25/14 by making it like GCC glue<br>
- KEDFPGM compile fails<br>
not really a 'source' issue, but exposed in source testing...<br>
- bad PPCOB code gen, LOAD api expansion exceeds col 71<br>
- result of issue 2 fix??<br>
fixed 9/25/14<br>
- KSDBLOAD compile fails<br>
not really a 'source' issue, but exposed in source testing...<br>
- cob2 doesn't like redefining 01 levels under FD<br>
fixed 9/25/14<br>
<br>
reported 9/23/14, fixed 9/25/14<br>
<span style="background-color: #00FFFF">8</span> z/OS install does not fully
support userid/prefix/literal HLQ due to missing support in the 2nd level rexx
($$V1R5M0) in the xmi.<br>
- rewrote rexx to provide arguments allowing HLQ to be overridden.<br>
- while I was at it I also provided ability to override volser.<br>
<br>
reported 9/26/14, fixed 9/26/14<br>
<span style="background-color: #00FFFF">9</span> license does not address
concern re LE/370 in distros leaving legacy (legacy MVS, VM/370) systems behind.<br>
- added restriction to license against incompatible objects<br>
<br>
reported 9/27/14, fixed 9/27/14<br>
<span style="background-color: #00FFFF">10</span> running test programs as part
of ADOALL in source install takes to long for no purpose.<br>
- made the last ADOALL step (running tests) optional<br>
<br>
reported 9/27/14, fixed 9/27/14<br>
<span style="background-color: #00FFFF">11</span> tempstor, intrapartition
queues, and source db not defined during CMS install. This due to not running
LOADSYS in POSTVSAM exec.<br>
- added LOADSYS to POSTVSAM<br>
<br>
<b>TSO, source, and CMS rawhides published 9/28/2014</b></p>
<p>reported 9/30/14, fixed 9/30/14<br>
<span style="background-color: #00FFFF">12</span> KEDF lines shown as green in
User's Guide are always blue...<br>
- some tn3270 clients enable 3270 base color mode, some don't. Most don't allow
a choice! This is not an issue normally, but KEDF screens are really busy and losing the
color separation of its screen areas when using a tn3270 client that does enable
base color mode is not helpful.<br>
- added attribute set into DOTOP to force green</p>
<p>last minute change! 10/2/14, fixed 10/12/14 <br>
<span style="background-color: #00FFFF">13</span> TSO version needs KICKS...SKIKLOAD
in addition to KICKSSYS...SKIKLOAD (like CMS version already has). This to simplify user table maintenance for
&quot;system install&quot; versions of <i><b>KICKS</b></i>.<br>
- updated both clist &amp; exec to create user libs if not already present, and to
incorporate into appropriate concatenations.
<p>reported 10/3/14, fixed 10/3/14<br>
<span style="background-color: #00FFFF">14</span> ksgmlic fails on mod 3 terms.
This due to incorrect map select (switched mod 3 &amp; mod 4).<br>
- corrected map select code.</p>
<p>reported 10/7/14, fixed 10/9/14<br>
<span style="background-color: #00FFFF">15</span> source trace compiles failing
IEC020I 001-4. compile proc(s) jcl issue, possible mismatch of blocksizes in
concatenation.<br>
- fixed source trace compile procs.</p>

<p>reported 10/9/14, fixed 10/9/14<br>
<span style="background-color: #00FFFF">16</span> source trace reporting source
date non-match when should report source not found. &quot;i16&quot; (used in startbr
call) was short but should be int.<br>
- made i16 int instead of short</p>

<p>reported 10/10/14, fixed 10/10/14<br>
<span style="background-color: #00FFFF">17</span> 'funny' chars in KEBRPGM
source code. Actually just a few &quot;[&quot; and &quot;]&quot; characters mistranslated (more ind$file mess ups) in a couple of comments, but fixed anyway...</p>
<p>reported 10/10/14 - resolved 10/13/14 - not a problem (but maybe worth a
comment in doc or KooKbooK someplace)<br>
<span style="background-color: #00FFFF">18</span>. KEDF source trace PF4 &quot;skip
subroutine&quot; did not return. <br>
- skip subroutine returns when the program gets to the next executable instruction,
but that may not
be the same as the next instruction the program executes! For example, consider</p>
<blockquote>
	IF blah blah THEN<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;
	PERFORM SKIP-THIS<br>
    ELSE<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;
	PERFORM MARKS-THIS-AS-RETURN.<br>
	PERFORM EXPECTED-RETURN-HERE.
</blockquote>
<p>if you were at &quot;PERFORM SKIP-THIS&quot; and pressed PF4 you might expect to return
to &quot;PERFORM EXPECTED-RETURN-HERE&quot;, but KEDF sets up the temporary
breakpoint at &quot;PERFORM MARKS-THIS-AS-RETURN&quot;, which is not hit so no &quot;return&quot; is
apparent.<br>
- working as designed!<br>
- <i>possible enhancement: PF16 (shift PF4) to do &quot;set temp BP at current
location (or
cursor) and go&quot;</i>.</p>

<p>reported 10/16/14, fixed 10/17/2014<br>
<span style="background-color: #00FFFF">19</span> when using source trace, and
no source is found, and a resp&lt;&gt;0 event occurs, the resp is not shown,
which is confusing since the only reason for the break is the bad resp! This due
to not calling api_resp before dobottom in those error cases in source_trace.<br>
- added required api_resp calls.</p>

<p>generated 10/20/14, <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">open</span><br>
<span style="background-color: #00FFFF">20</span> this is to document some
'rough edges' in the KEBR program..<br>
- analyze-cursor sometime reports wrong when cursor on &quot;**bottom**&quot; or bottom
ruler line of hex display<br>
- repeated find sometimes does not switch directions properly<br>
- need KooKbooK recipe for CICS install&nbsp; &#10003;(see issue 27)<br>
- online help could be improved to show *all* commands instead of just those new
or different from CEBR; also vget should note the vsam file name is as in the
FCT (ie, its DDN), not as in its DSN.<br>
- 'checksum' partially implemented to detect queue changed since last displayed;
needs to be finished...<br>
- find highlight could be improved. 'scroll to' highlighting a bit confusing<br>

<p>reported 10/20/14, fixed 10/23/2014<br>
<span style="background-color: #00FFFF">21</span> KEBR does not find short tdq/file
names in get/vget if an optional argument is present<br>
- changed to move only up to first space to tdq/file name</p>

<p>reported 10/23/14, resolved 10/23/14 - not a problem<br>
<span style="background-color: #00FFFF">22</span> some dates in the issues list
are beyond the
&quot;last updated date&quot; at the bottom of the page<br>- &quot;Last updated date&quot;
refers to the Appendices document, but the issues list is a server side include
and can change without the Appendices document changing. Added 'issues last
updated' to bottom of the include...<br>

<p>feature request 10/30/14, request declined 11/11/14<br>
<span style="background-color: #00FFFF">24</span> show &quot;source listing not found&quot;
message only once per program per task instead of for every source statement.<br>
- really only an issue for a program that was compiled with source trace, but
the source code database has since been reinitialized so the source is no longer
available. Options: recompile (with or without source trace), switch to API mode
(PF2), or just turn off
source trace (PF13).<br>
- 4/22/16 - changed 'SOURCE LISTING NOT FOUND' msg suffixing ', PRESS PF2 FOR API MODE'.<br>

<p>reported 11/9/14, resolved 11/9/14 - ** unpublished **<br>
<span style="background-color: #00FFFF">25</span> On TK4- system, where <i><b>
KICKS</b></i> &quot;system install&quot; done, tso source build ADOALL step ADO11 submitted jobs (LOADMUR, LOADTAC, LOADSDB, LOADTEMP, LOADINTR) fail due to RAKF issue, unable to delete vsam file(s).<br>
- cause is that specific RAKF rules exist for these (system install use) files, and the default id
associated with intrdr job isn't allowed to delete. Maybe not a big deal, since
this step isn't actually necessary to the build; the files are already built in
the course of the normal <i><b>KICKS</b></i> install.<br>
- solution: delete step 11 since it is not necessary anyway<br>
<p>observed 11/16/14, resolved 11/19/14 - ** unpublished **<br>
<span style="background-color: #00FFFF">26</span> Syncpoint exit may foul up
pseudo conversational tasks. Fixing this turned out to be one of those efforts
that kept turning up mostly unrelated minor issues that also got fixed along the
way, as noted.<br>
- fixed KCP code calling exit to preserve calen &amp; nextran<br>
- also noted and fixed related issue in PCP setting nextran<br>
- also noted and fixed tempstor &amp; intrapartition queue 'empty startup' problem<br>
- also upgraded SIP auxtrace to show more decoded trace entries<br>
