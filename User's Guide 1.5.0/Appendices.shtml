<h2>Appendix A – TSO (or CMS) versus CICS versus KICKS</h2>
<p>Paraphrasing Wikipedia’s TSO entry (<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Sharing_Option">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Sharing_Option</a>),</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><i>The Time Sharing Option (TSO) is an interactive time-sharing
	environment for IBM mainframe operating systems running from OS/MVT through
	MVS and OS/390 to the current z/OS. &quot;Time-sharing&quot; means that many persons
	can access MVS concurrently but each is unaware that the operating system is
	being accessed by others - so it appears to each TSO user that he or she is
	the only user on the system. TSO is most commonly used by mainframe system
	administrators and programmers because it provides: a text editor; the
	ability to submit batch jobs, be notified of their completion and view the
	results without waiting for printed reports; debuggers for some of the
	programming languages used on System/360 and later IBM mainframes; other
	vendors' end-user applications, for example for querying IMS and DB2
	databases. The name &quot;Time Sharing Option&quot; derives from the fact that, when
	it was originally introduced in the 1960s, time-sharing was considered an
	&quot;optional feature&quot;, as compared to standard batch processing, and hence TSO
	was offered as an optional feature of OS/MVT. It became a standard part of
	MVS in 1974. TSO interacts with users in either a line-by-line mode or in a
	full screen, menu-driven mode. In the line-by-line mode, the user enters
	commands by typing them in at the keyboard; in turn, the system interprets
	the commands, and then displays responses on the terminal screen. TSO
	commands can be embedded in clists which can be run either interactively or
	in batch. </i></p>

<p>Paraphrasing Wikipedia’s CICS entry (<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CICS">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CICS</a>),</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><i>CICS (Customer Information Control System) is a transaction server
	that runs primarily on IBM mainframe systems. It is a transaction manager
	designed for rapid, high-volume online processing. This processing is mostly
	interactive (screen-oriented), but background transactions are possible.
	While CICS has its highest profile among financial institutions such as
	banks and insurance companies, over 90 percent of Fortune 500 companies are
	reported to rely on CICS for their core business function], along with many
	government entities. CICS is used in bank-teller applications, ATM systems,
	industrial production control systems, insurance applications, and many
	other types of interactive applications. A CICS transaction is a set of
	operations which together perform a task. Usually, the majority of
	transactions are relatively simple tasks such as requesting an inventory
	list or entering a debit or credit to an account. A primary characteristic
	of a transaction is that it should be atomic. On large mainframes CICS
	easily supports thousands of transactions per second, making it a mainstay
	of enterprise computing. Each CICS program is initiated using a transaction
	identifier. CICS screens are sent as a construct called a map, a little
	program created with BMS (Basic Mapping Support) assembler macros. The end
	user inputs data, which is made accessible to the program by receiving a map
	from CICS. </i></p>
	<p><i>The first release of the CICS Program Product developed by IBM became
	available on July 8, 1969. CICS was originally developed in the United
	States at an IBM Development Center in Des Plaines, Illinois, beginning in
	1966. Since 1974 CICS development has been at IBM's Hursley, United Kingdom
	Laboratory. When CICS was first released, it supported programs written in
	IBM Assembler, PL/I and COBOL. Programs needed to be quasi-reentrant in
	order to support multiple concurrent transaction threads. CICS services
	emulated the functions of the operating system, but provided services
	tailored to support only transaction processing that were more efficient
	than the generalized services in the operating system and much simpler for
	programmers to use, particularly with respect to communication with terminal
	devices. CICS owes its early popularity to its relatively efficient
	implementation, its multi-threaded processing architecture, and its relative
	simplicity for developing terminal based applications. Today CICS has
	millions of applications worldwide that have been executing reliably for
	decades.</i></p>

<p>And paraphrasing the TSO TIMES (see

http://www.tsotimes.com/articles/archive/fall03/historyoftsopart2.html</a>),</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><i>The most descriptive word for TSO is conversational. Conversational,
	in a shared computing context, means that each TSO user logged on to MVS has
	their own address space. The hallmark of a conversational environment is the
	long term holding of what could be a shared resource. That is, a resource
	(file, memory, source member) is held onto as long as a user is using it.
	The term for this is think time. Something like editing a program (which can
	take many hours of think time) would be a good example of a conversational
	task. For the entire time that a TSO user is editing a file, an exclusive
	lock is maintained on the file being edited. No one else can edit the same
	file while the original TSO user edits it. </i></p>
	<p><i>To underscore the conversational nature of TSO sessions, compare TSO
	to CICS which is said to be pseudo-conversational. In the simplest sense,
	the difference can be seen in the following graphics.</i></p>

					<p style="margin-top: 0"><font size="2">CICS has a single

					number of terminals connected to it. It is a task-based

					task is run to display data on the user's terminal screen
					and sometimes the displayed data is updated. However during
					the time that occurs between the initial request to view
					data and the eventual update of the data, no locks are held
					(unless explicitly programmed) and other terminal users are
					free to inquire against the same data. What this means is

	</blockquote>
	<p><i>With CICS, all terminals sign-on to a single address space. The CICS
	software manages this multi-tasking, concurrent terminal access by using a
	standard api. This is a one-to-many relationship: One CICS region (address
	space), many users attached to it. </i></p>
	<p><i>TSO is a direct one-to-one relationship: One user, one address space.
	</i></p>
	<p><i>Because of this, even on a large MVS mainframe, TSO consumes far too
	many finite resources to be a viable application platform for a large group
	of users. This is why CICS followed on to TSO and became the dominant
	teleprocessing monitor for heavy-duty, high volume business applications—it
	is far less expensive in terms of machine utilization.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what about <i><b>KICKS</b></i>, trying to be a CICS environment running
under TSO or CMS? </p>
<p>Ideally <i><b>KICKS</b></i> provides a happy combination of the TSO/CMS and CICS
worlds: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Each <i><b>KICKS</b></i> user runs in his own address space, so when an
	application problem occurs it should only affect the user that is running
	that application. </li>
	<li>As <i><b>KICKS</b></i> applications use the CICS pseudo-conversational
	model think time will normally result in the <i><b>KICKS</b></i> user’s TSO
	address space being swapped out so it should consume minimum system memory.
	</li>
	<li><i><b>KICKS</b></i> has shared files open only between reading the input
	terminal screen and writing the output terminal screen, so file contention
	should be low. This also avoids the need for gigantic regions. </li>
</ul>
<p>The above advantages are also the seeds of the major limitations <i><b>KICKS</b></i>
faces: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Memory swapping and file open/close processing are things CICS does
	not do at all (at least on a transaction basis) – so <i><b>KICKS</b></i> is
	automatically incurring per-transaction overhead way over what CICS has.
	“Thousands of transactions per second” is never going to happen! </li>
</ul>
<p>Although <i><b>KICKS</b></i> now supports nearly all of the CICS command
level programming api, a big <i><b>KICKS</b></i> advantage over CICS
is freedom from the CICS api! If you don’t care about compatibility, techniques
that would crash a CICS system will work very well in <b> <i>KICKS</i></b>. Some
examples: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Need ISAM or BDAM files? Set them up in the COBOL program just as you
	would for a batch job! (these files don't need to be defined in the <i><b>
	KICKS</b></i> FCT, but remember to allocate and free them in your <b><i>
	KICKS</i></b> startup clist).</li>
	<li>Want to use the COBOL Sort? Set it up in the COBOL program just as you
	would for a batch job! </li>
	<li>Want to use the COBOL Report Writer for your reports? Set it up in the
	COBOL program just as you would for a batch job!&nbsp; Or write the report
	to a temporary file and then use the SPOOLOPEN api to write lines from the
	temporary file to any printer for finer control.</li>
	<li>Want to use the COBOL Report Writer for your screens? Same as using it
	for a report, only write temporary file lines to the screen with SEND TEXT
	(or define a map and use SEND MAP).</li>
	<li>Need help figuring out where your program is going wrong? Of course KEDF
	and its source trace
	is probably the easiest way to do this, but there's no reason you can't use
	COBOL's own DISPLAY, EXHIBIT or TRACE commands to track your program's
	progress if you want to.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="AppendixB"></a>Appendix B – Frequently Asked Questions </h2>
<p><u>Q. Where can I find manuals for the legacy COBOL compiler? </u></p>
<blockquote>
	<p>A. The manuals for the legacy COBOL compiler (360S-CB-545, 360S-LM-546) 
	used in the MVS Turnkey and the VM/370 six pack, are <u>COBOL Manual</u> GC28-6396 and <u>COBOL Programmer’s Guide</u>
GC28-6399. Both are on Bitsavers (<a href="http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/ibm/360/os/cobol/">bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/ibm/360/os/cobol</a>). Other than those manuals
the best reference I’ve found is Jay Moseley’s &quot;Assembling, Compiling,
Link-Editing, and Executing User-Written Programs&quot; page (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.jaymoseley.com/hercules/compiling/compile.htm">http://www.jaymoseley.com/hercules/compiling/compile.htm</a>).
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Q. I’m using a ‘programmer generated’ symbolic map but it doesn’t
work right </u></p>
<blockquote>
	<p>A. This might happen because your programmer generated symbolic map does
	not match the symbolic map that <i><b>KICKS</b></i> generates. Check that
	there are no missing or changed fields between the two. Older versions of <i>
	<b>KICKS</b></i> did not support DSATTS/MAPATTS in the map generation and
	instead changed them to EXTATT, resulting in more or fewer bytes in the
	symbolic map than might otherwise be expected. <i><b>KICKS</b></i> now honors DSATTS/MAPATTS
	and should produce symbolic maps fully compatible (in this respect) with
	CICS.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><u>Q. I’m getting enqueue timeouts (30 second pause, then AFCT/ADCT
abend). </u></p>
<blockquote>
	<p>A. Also RESP=19, RESP2=99 if you are trapping errors. This is probably
	due to a <b><i>KICKS</i></b> batch job or perhaps an online conversational
	transaction holding on to a file for a long time, preventing other
	transactions like yours from being able to access the file. Batch jobs and
	conversational transactions should periodically release their files
	(SYNCPOINT) to allow others to operate normally. </p>
	<p>This can also be caused by someone using KEDF to debug a transaction that
	uses the file your transaction is trying to access. KEDF freezes
	transactions at each api call, so transactions that might ordinarily hold a
	file for a fraction of a second can end up holding the file indefinitely
	while a programmer is slowly stepping thru the code analyzing its progress.
	The best cure for this problem is to insist programmers use a different set
	of files for their debugging.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Q. My printout of CRLP batch runs has a few characters that are different
from what's shown here. </u></p>
<blockquote>
	<p>A. And/Or my screen displays show different (or even missing) characters
	from what's shown here. These are symptoms of 'CODEPAGE' issues, translating
	EBCDIC characters to ASCII characters on your printouts and/or tn3270
	client. Under hercules you
	should use &quot;CODEPAGE 819/1047&quot; in your hercules.conf file (the one you use
	to start hercules, define all you disks &amp; termnals, etc). This should
	fix printout problems. Making the same codepage selection for your tn3270
	client should fix screen problems.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><u>Q. I’m getting a VER1 abend. </u></p>
<blockquote>
	<p>A. VER1 abend means your program was not compiled for the current version
	of <b><i>KICKS</i></b>. You should recompile it.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><u>Q. I’m getting a VER2 abend. </u></p>
<blockquote>
	<p>A. VER2 abend also means your program was not compiled for the current
	version of <b><i>KICKS</i></b>. You should recompile it. This abend usually
	happens instead of a VER1 abend if you attempt to just relink your program
	instead of compile and relink...</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><u>Q. I’m getting a VER3 abend. </u></p>
<blockquote>
	<p>A. VER3 abend might mean your program was not compiled for the current
	version of <b><i>KICKS</i></b>, but usually means there is a problem with
	your COBOL compile options. <i><b>KICKS</b></i> programs require that PIC
	S9(4) COMP items be able to hold halfword numbers (ie, -32768 to + 32767),
	so you must specify whatever compiler option does that on your machine.
	Probably something like <u>NOTRUNC</u> or <u>TRUNC(BIN)</u> as seen in the
	standard <i><b>KICKS</b></i> COBOL compile procs.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><u>Q. I’m getting an ATCP
abend. </u></p>
<blockquote>
	<p>A. Also RESP=222, RESP2=?? if you are trapping errors. This can happen
	when you are using the &quot;FULLSCR&quot; version of TCP (2$) in TSO when
	you do a SEND MAP (or SEND TEXT) and that results in an attempt to send
	invalid characters to the terminal. TCP=2$ checks outbound
	messages for characters (0x01,.0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x06, 0x14, 0x15, 0x16,
	0x17, 0x24, 0x26, 0x37, and 0x3D) that would be filtered (turned into colons) by the TSO
	&quot;tput fullscr&quot; macro, and if it finds any it produces this abend and aborts sending
	the data to the terminal. RESP2 will be the offset from the beginning of the
	message (which is displayed as the 'TIOA' in the formatted dump) to the
	first invalid character.</p>
	<p>This error is unique to the &quot;FULLSCR&quot; version of TCP (2$) used with older
	distributions of the Tur(n)key MVS system. It is not generated with the &quot;NOEDIT&quot; version of TCP (1$)
	always used in
	z/OS, nor in any of the CMS versions of <i><b>KICKS</b></i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Q. My application can't lock the keyboard. </u></p>
<blockquote>
	<p>A. Older version of <i><b>KICKS</b></i> always unlocked the keyboard
	regardless of the application specification (ie, FREEKB), but more current
	version of <i><b>KICKS</b></i> honor (by default) the application
	specification. To revert to the older behavior set the SIT parameter FFREEKB=YES.</p>
	<p>A. The TSO tput macro, as used by the &quot;FULLSCR&quot; version of TCP (2$, 
	default in legacy MVS) in TSO , ignores the
	FREEKB bit in the 3270 WCC and always unlocks the keyboard. To obtain
	keyboard lock functionality in the TSO version of <i><b>KICKS</b></i> you
	must use the &quot;NOEDIT&quot; version of TCP (1$, which is the default in 
	z/OS).</p>
	<p>This does not apply to CMS; all
	CMS version of the terminal driver support keyboard lock.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Q. I’m getting a &quot;Alternate 3270 screen &gt; 4095 chars, ignoring&quot; startup
message. </u></p>
<blockquote>
	<p>A. The TSO tput macro, as used by the &quot;FULLSCR&quot; version of TCP (2$, 
	default in legacy MVS), can only use 12 bit sba's due to its inability to use certain characters
	that might occur using 14 bit sba's. This limits its maximum screen size to
	4095 characters. To work with larger screens in the TSO version of <i><b>KICKS</b></i> you
	must use the &quot;NOEDIT&quot; version of TCP (1$, which is the default in 
	z/OS).</p>
	<p>This does not apply to CMS;
	all CMS version of the terminal driver support large screens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Q. Can <i><b>KICKS</b></i> share VSAM files with CICS?</u></p>
<blockquote>
	<p>A. No. <i><b>KICKS</b></i> VSAM file sharing works by opening and closing
files as necessary. CICS does not close files until explicitly asked to, so once
CICS has opened the file (usually when it starts, sometimes not until first use)
	<i><b>KICKS</b></i> probably won't be able to get it. If it does get it (because
the file's VSAM share options are defined to allow it) <u>that's a very bad
thing</u>, since neither <i><b>KICKS</b></i> nor CICS will know the other is
using the file...</p>
	<p>Different versions of <b><i>KICKS</i></b> <u>can</u> share VSAM files
	without issue. A older version with the current, or the free version with <font face="Times New Roman"> <i><b>KICKS<font color="#FF0000">pro</font></b></i></font>,
	etc.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><u>Q. Is <b> <i>KICKS </i></b>available in other languages? </u>
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>A. <i><b>KICKS</b></i> is localized for American English (en-US). If you 
	translate some components to your own locale please upload your work to the 'files' area
	in the support forum (
	<a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/kicksfortso/info">
	https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/kicksfortso/info</a> ) so that others don't
	need to reinvent the wheel. Thanks in advance!!</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><u>Q.&nbsp; DFHBMF?? is missing from KIKBMSCA</u></p>
<blockquote>
	<p>A. The DFHBMSCA copy member defines a number of useful 3270 attributes,
	but by no means all of them. Even the member IBM distributes for CICS does
	not cover all possibilities, and some find it's naming convention difficult.
	The prevailing wisdom is to not use DFHBMSCA, but to code and use your own
	attribute definition member with the names and combinations you like - or,
	equivalently from my perspective, to use a 'shop standard' attribute
	definition member. See for example
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nwrdc.fsu.edu/mainframe/bms-attribute-names">http://www.nwrdc.fsu.edu/mainframe/bms-attribute-names</a>
	or others you can easily find Googling DFHBMSCA. As such the BMSCA I supply
	is just a starting point for your efforts if you don't have something
	better. About the only time I add to it is if I need something for an
	example program.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><u>Q. Do paid licenses include &quot;support&quot;? </u>
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>A. I offer free basic support with all licenses, paid or otherwise. However,
	recognizing that some customers require a higher level of support I offer
	&quot;guaranteed response&quot; telephone and/or online support on a prepaid basis. If you
	require
	such support please contact me. </p>

Issues List</h2>
<p><b>TSO rawhide published 9/3/2014<br>
</b><br>
generated 9/3/14, <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">open</span><br>
<span style="background-color: #00FFFF">1</span>. noticed the READY READY issue
in z/OS. This is a long standing issue but not one I have seen previously except
in legacy MVS with the tcp=1$ driver. What happens is that, now and then, after the
colored 'KICKS is shutting down' message is shown you don't get the TSO ready
prompt. When you press enter again you get two READY prompts (usually white, not
red in legacy MVS). This does not happen with tcp=2$ or with any CMS tcp...<br>
- can't reliably make the problem appear, so difficult to tell if attempted
fixes work...<br>
- maybe due to leaving 'strange' stuff on the screen (such as the SA orders
associated with the shutting down message when <i><b>KICKS</b></i> ends.<br>
- fix? -9/3/2014 - changed KSSFPGM to do a clear screen after 2 second delay after
sending the colored shutdown mesage - so that the screen TSO sees will be
totally blank.<br>
** not the problem, 'fix' had no effect, issue remains<br>
- maybe due to not doing a read after colored letter write? Noted on z/OS that
the colored letters where not showing up!<br>
- fix? -9/25/14 - changed KSSFPGM to do a 'check' after colored letters write.<br>
** 10/4/2014&nbsp; <u>nope, not fixed</u> - READY READY appeared again (in
legacy MVS).<br>
- more info --&nbsp; 2/16/2015 can now reliably generate issue (on legacy MVS).
Generating procedure does not
generate ready-ready on z/OS, but does display possibly related issue in that
the KB is not locked after clear. Also noticed that I need to use QWS to test
this, as vista tn3270 seems to have a bug this procedure exposes ('short read'
for enter aid following clear aid). Also confirmed my &quot;expected&quot; result is
correct by trying in real CICS, and confirmed that it works properly in all CMS
versions of <i><b>KICKS</b></i> (and, within driver limitations, with tcp=2$ in
legacy MVS). At this point I'm testing to see if ready-ready may
be related to <i><b>KICKS</b></i> being called, not a command processor. <br>
<br>
reported 9/3/14, fixed 9/4/14<br>
<span style="background-color: #00FFFF">2</span>. KEBRPGM does not compile in
z/OS
due to compile diagnostic complaining about kik-aids1 being moved to a pointer
type.<br>
- this due to LOAD api (for KEBRHELP) generating code for 'move after' from
kik-aids1 used (off label) for entry/set to a pointer.<br>
- fix: updated KIKPPCOB (and PPGCC) to use given arg directly.<br>
- also, while I was at it, updated PPCOB, PPGCC, KIKPCP1$, and KEDF to separate
SET/ENTRY (now reporting both) and to make all LOAD args optional.<br>

<span style="background-color: #00FFFF">4</span>. GCC test program LINKTST fails
due to 'testcob3' not abending!<br>
- this due to testcob3 not detecting condition to do FCP access to file NOFILE,
thus not abending. This due to PPGCC generating bad code in the case of an api
call directly following an if (ie, no preceding '{'), When that occurred PPGCC
gened a {linenum} {api expansion}, meaning the api expansion would not be within
the if as intended.<br>
- fix: updated PPGCC to add another set of brackets so it looks like {{linenum}
{api expansion}}<br>
- also, while I was at it, updated PPGCC to turn (8) error for missing KIKEIB in
main routine def into warning (4).<br>

PPCOB and PPGCC should have their recognition of it removed as well.<br>

NOTE - z/OS is not a &quot;supported&quot; build platform for <i><b>KICKS</b></i>,

comment in doc or KooKbooK someplace)<br>
<span style="background-color: #00FFFF">18</span>. KEDF source trace PF4 &quot;skip

- skip subroutine returns when the program gets to the next executable instruction,
but that may not
be the same as the next instruction the program executes! For example, consider</p>
<blockquote>
	IF blah blah THEN<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;
	PERFORM SKIP-THIS<br>
    ELSE<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;
	PERFORM MARKS-THIS-AS-RETURN.<br>
	PERFORM EXPECTED-RETURN-HERE.
</blockquote>
<p>if you were at &quot;PERFORM SKIP-THIS&quot; and pressed PF4 you might expect to return
to &quot;PERFORM EXPECTED-RETURN-HERE&quot;, but KEDF sets up the temporary
breakpoint at &quot;PERFORM MARKS-THIS-AS-RETURN&quot;, which is not hit so no &quot;return&quot; is
apparent.<br>

- cause is that specific RAKF rules exist for these (system install use) files, and the default id
